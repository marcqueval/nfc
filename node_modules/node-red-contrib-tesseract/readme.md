# Tesseract
Tesseract.js is a pure Javascript port of the popular Tesseract OCR engine. It performs all OCR tasks locally without requiring a connection to any external service.

Tesseract was originally developed at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories Bristol and at Hewlett-Packard Co, Greeley Colorado between 1985 and 1994, with some more changes made in 1996 to port to Windows, and some C++izing in 1998. In 2005 Tesseract was open sourced by HP. Since 2006 it is developed by Google.
